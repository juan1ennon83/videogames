# **PI Videogames by Full Stack Dev Juan Salva**

This is an individual project requested by #soyHenry Bootcamp in which I used Javascript for both Back and Front End design.
For my BackEnd, I used Express as framework and a #postgres SQL Db with Sequelize as an ORM to retrieve the data.


## **Project Description**

In this project, we retrieve data from an API and copy it onto a new one which will also store Created game titles by the user. You can navigate and Sort by Genre, Ascendant, Descendant and Rating Criterias.

Main features:

- **Videogame Browse**: Users can browse and visualize detailed descriptions about several videogames. Details provided are Title, Description, Genre, Platform, Release Date and Rating with ASC and DESC Sorting.
- **External API retrieve**: The app connects to an external API externa to retrieve data from an updated Database from a the third party "RAWG"
- **New Title Creator**: User can also create a New Title through this option.
